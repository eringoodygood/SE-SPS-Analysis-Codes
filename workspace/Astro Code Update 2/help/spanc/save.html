<h2>Saving Spanc Data</h2>
<p>You many save the state of a Spanc session at any time. In
the 'File' menu, select 'Save Data...' to save your entered
targets, calibration reactions, calibration peaks, and output peaks
to a file.  'Load Data' may then be used to load this information
back into Spanc.</p>  

<h2>Text Export</h2>
<p>You may also select the 'Text Export...' menu item
to create a text file showing all your entered information and
calibration results in a human-readable format. 'Table Export..' is similar to text export. The report is more of 
a summary than a listing of all information, and it is in tab-delimited
form for easy import into spreadsheet software.</p>
