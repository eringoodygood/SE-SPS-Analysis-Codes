<h1>Entering
Target Information</H1>
<p>Select
the 'List Targets...' option from the Targets menu.  This displays
the 'Target List' dialog box.  To add a new target, click the button
'Add' in this dialog box.  A 'Define Target' dialog box appears.  By
default, this dialog box shows information for a 20 &#181;g/cm&#178;
carbon target.  If this is what is desired, all that is necessary is
to give it a name, and click 'OK'.</P>
<p>The
target definition table in the 'Define Target' dialog has one row for
each layer in a target. Layer 0 is the first layer the beam
encounters, and each successive Layer number is the next layer
downstream. Layers may be added by clicking 'Add Layer'.  This adds a
layer to the end of the list, which is given a default value of 20
&#181;g/cm&#178; of carbon.
 If you click on a row, and then click 'Remove Layer', that layer
gets removed from the table.</P>
<p>The
'Components' cell for a layer may be edited to specify what elements
are in the layer in what proportions.  The format is simple.  For
each element, type an element symbol followed by a space and a number.  The numbers should
represent the relative numbers of atoms of each element in the
target. For example, silicon dioxide would be entered as &quot;Si 1 O
2&quot;. The 'Thickness' cell for a layer may be edited to give the
thickness in &#181;g/cm&#178;
for that layer.</P>
<p>Clicking
'OK' or 'Apply' creates the target object. It will now be listed in
the 'Target List' dialog box.  Selecting one of the targets in the
list, and clicking 'Display' will display a 'Display Target' dialog. 
In it, you will see the target as you defined it.  Note that the
numbers for each element will be renormalized to a total of 1. I
recommend that you always display a target after creating it, in
order to double check that it was created properly.</P>
<p>Targets
may be deleted by selecting them in 'Target List', and clicking
'Remove'.</P>
