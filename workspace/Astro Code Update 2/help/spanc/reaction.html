Reaction Information</H1>
<p>A
reaction in Spanc is specified by a beam nuclide, beam energy,
spectrometer B-field, target, interaction layer, target nuclide,
projectile nuclide, projectile charge state, and spectrometer angle. 
All this information may be entered for a new reaction by clicking
'Add Reaction' in the 'Calibration Reactions' section of the main
window.  This displays an 'Add Reaction' dialog.</P>
<p>The
'Beam' and 'Projectile' fields are for specifying the nuclides.  In
them, you must enter the nuclide in the form AAAZZZ, where AA is the
mass number of the nucleus, and ZZZ is the element symbol.  For
example, silicon-29 would be entered as &quot;29Si&quot;.  The beam
energy is entered in MeV, and the B-field is entered in kG.  The
target is specified by choosing one of your entered targets from a
dropdown list.  The layer that your reaction is assumed to occur in
must then be selected from the 'Layer' slider.  'Target Nuclide' is a
drop-down list containing all known isotopes of elements in your
chosen target layer. Select the desired isotope. Q is an integer
representing the charge state of your projectile.  Finally, the angle
of the spectrometer must be entered in degrees.</P>
<p>For
every nuclide participating in the reaction, it is possible to
specify the mass as having uncertainty.  When calibrating an
experiment internally, i.e. using well known calibration peaks from
the same reaction as the output peaks, the masses can be treated as
exact.  However, when different reaction channels are used for
calibrating, any different reactants and products should have their
mass uncertainties counted.</P>
<p>Clicking
'OK' or 'Apply' creates the reaction, and adds it to the 'Calibration
Reactions' table in the main window.  Each reaction has a number
associated with it in the 'Reaction' column, which you will use when
specifying calibration peaks and output peaks. Selecting a row in the
reaction table, and clicking 'Remove Reaction' will delete a reaction
from the list.</P>
