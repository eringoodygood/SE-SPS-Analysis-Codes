<h1>JRelKin</h1>
<p>In this program, the user enters beam, target,
and projectile nuclei in the table at the top. The residual
nucleus is determined automatically, and Q0, the ground-state
Q-value is displayed. If QO is negative, it represents the amount
of energy needed in the center-of-mass system for this reaction
to occur.</p>

<p>Single or multiple beam energies, residual excitations, and
spectrometer angles may be entered. For each, two options are
given: <em>List of Values</em> or <em>Min Max Delta</em>. For One Value, 
just
enter a single value in the text field. For <em>Min Max Delta</em>, enter 
a minimum
value, maximum value, and step value separated by spaces. For <em>List of 
Values</em>, enter as many values as you like, separated by spaces.
For all entries, hitting enter causes the change, and JRelKin
automatically recalculates and updates the table. Additionally,
there is a target thickness field, which will cause the beam
energy, projectile kinetic energy, and projectile QB&#961; values to
be modified for energy losses. The target is assumed to be made
entirely of the same element as the target nuclide.</p>

<p>The column headings in the JRelKin results table are as
follows:</p>

<dl>
<dt>T(1)</dt>

<dd>Kinetic energy in MeV of the beam in the lab system. If a
non-zero target thickness is given, this is the beam energy at
halfway through the target.</dd>

<dt>Ex(4)</dt>

<dd>Excitation energy of the residual nucleus in MeV.</dd>

<dt>Lab &#952;(3)</dt>

<dd>Angle in degrees of the projectile in the lab system.</dd>

<dt>CM &#952;(3)</dt>

<dd>Angle in degrees of the projectile in the center-of-mass
system.</dd>

<dt>T(3)</dt>

<dd>Kinetic energy in MeV of the projectile in the lab system. If
a non-zero target thickness is given, this is the kinetic energy
after traversing the remainder of the target.</dd>

<dt>Lab &#952;(4)</dt>

<dd>Angle in degrees of the residual in the lab system.</dd>

<dt>T(4)</dt>

<dd>Kinetic energy in MeV of the residual in the lab system.</dd>

<dt>Jac(3)</dt>

<dd>The Jacobian for the projectile for transforming between the
lab and center-of-mass systems.</dd>

<dt>k(3)</dt>

<dd>Kinematic shift parameter for determining the position of the
focal plane of the spectrometer. k=1/p * dp/dTheta for the
projectile.</dd>

<dt>z</dt>

<dd>Only useful at WNSL. Our digital readout for the detector
position will read this value for the detector sitting properly
at the focal plane. See the page on SplitPole <a
href="http://wnsl.physics.yale.edu/astro/enge/setup">setup</a> at WNSL.</dd>

<dt>QB&#961;(3)</dt>

<dd>Magnetic rigidity in e-kG-cm of the projectile in the lab
system. This value is derived directly from T(3), and so is also
affected by finite target thickness.</dd>
