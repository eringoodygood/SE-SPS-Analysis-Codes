<h1>SpecPlot Instructions</h1>
<p>This code will plot position spectra on the focal plane
detector for multiple reaction channels. You must specify an input file 
by selecting <code>File|Open...</code>. A sample input file is
here: <a href="35MeV_10B_t.inp"><code>35MeV_10B_t.inp</code></a>.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Note:</dt>
<dd>Many of the fields in the input file are leftover from the
Particle ID simulation code, <code>PIDplotYaleOld</code>. While the values
specifying absorbers must be present for the input file to be parsed, they
are ignored in the calculations of projectile radii.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Excitation energies for the residual nucleus are automatically
loaded from a file called <code><a
href="excitations.dat">excitations.dat</a></code>, which must be
in the same directory as the input file. You may modify the files
given here as needed. The format should be self-explanatory. You
may specify as many reaction channels as you wish at the end of
the <code>.inp</code> file.</p>
