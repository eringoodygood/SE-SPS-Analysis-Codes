<H1>SPANC
-- SPectrograph ANalysis Code</H1>
<h2>Functional
Description of Code</H2>
<p>Spanc
is a code created for easier calibrations of position
spectra from magnetic spectrometer experiments.  In particular, it
was created for use at Yale University for analyzing spectra from our
Enge spectrograph. In Spanc, the user enters descriptions of the
targets and reactions used in an experiment. Then, they enter
information about peaks which are to be used for calibration of the
spectra.  Spanc can then fit the calibration peaks with polynomials
of order 1 through 8.  Radius (&#961;)
is fitted as a function of spectrum channel.  The user can then enter
additional peaks, along with which reaction they are associated with.
Spanc will return back estimates of &#961;
and excitation energy, based on the calibration curve. Spanc can save
input data, calibration info, and output data to a file, which can
then be loaded back in later on.  Also, Spanc can save a report to a
text file of the input data, calibration, and output data.</P>
