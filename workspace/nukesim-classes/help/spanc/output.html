<h1>Entering
Output Peaks</H1>
<p>Output
peaks in Spanc are specified by a reaction, a projectile excitation
energy, and a channel. Output peaks are displayed in the bottom
section of the main window, and are entered in a very similar fashion
to the calibration peaks.  Clicking 'Add Peak' in the 'Output Peaks'
section displays an 'Add Output Peak' dialog.</P>
<p>Again,
you <B>must</B>  slide the 'Reaction' slider to the desired reaction
number, even if it appears to already be selected.  The projectile
excitation energy is again presumed to be exact and given a default
value of zero, which you may change. Channel number and uncertainty
are entered just as with the calibration peaks.</P>
<p>Clicking
'OK' or 'Apply' creates the output peak.   If a calibration fit has
already been performed, the peak is added to the table in the 'Output
Peaks' section.  In this table, a fitted value for &#961;
is displayed. The excitation energy for the residual nucleus is
calculated for this &#961;
by adding back the energy loss to the interaction point in the
target, then working the two-body kinematics in reverse. The
excitation energy error bar is determined from the &#961;,
which has its error bar calculated as described below.</P>
<p>Two
sources of error are added in quadrature: the channel uncertainty in
the output peak, and the prediction interval one gets assuming the
output peak channel were known exactly.  The former simply comes from
multiplying the channel error bar by the slope of the fit function
evaluated at the channel.  The second is the Prediction Interval,
calculated by the following formula:</P>

and

</P>
<p>The
<IMG SRC="SpancManual_html_m11a2c42.gif" NAME="Object4" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=48 HEIGHT=25>
are the same effective y-error bars used to calculate the fit. For a
t-distribution with r degrees of freedom, the probability for values
greater than t(&#945;;r) is equal
to &#945;. This t-distribution is
the appropriate sampling distribution for the calculated fit values.
&#945; in the above expression
for the prediction interval is chosen to be 1-0.683, where 0.683 is
the probability inside &plusmn;1&#963;
for the standard normal distribution.</P>
<p>Notice
that the Prediction Interval has a parabolic form where the
prediction uncertainty is lowest at the center of the calibration
data.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Adjusted Error Bars</H4>
<p>There is a  checkbox in
the output peaks section for adjusting error bars.  If this box is
checked and &#967;&#178;/&#957;
is greater than 1, the prediction interval error bars get multiplied
by the square root of &#967;&#178;/&#957;
 This is to attempt to compensate for a poor quality calibration by
amplifying the uncertainty.  It is equivalent to assuming that your
calibration peak error bars were under-estimated by a factor which
would give the expected value of &#967;&#178;/&#957;=1.
This is not a statistically justifiable procedure, but it can come in
handy when one is trying to get a rough calibration of a data set.</P>
