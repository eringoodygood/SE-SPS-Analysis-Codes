<h1>Performing a
Fit</H1>
<p>Spanc
performs linear regressions to fit &#961;
as a function of channel using polynomial.  The polynomials may be
1st order thru 4th order.  The dependence fit is as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>&#961;=
a0 + a1&#183;(Channel - Channel[0]) + a2&#183;(Channel - Channel[0])&#178; +
...</P>
<p>Channel[0]
is simply the unweighted mean of all the calibration peak channels. 
It is exact, and not really a parameter of the fit.  Rather, it is a
constant shift of the data made in order to reduce the covariance
between the a0 and a1 terms.  (In an unweighted 1st-order linear
regression, this transformation actually eliminates the covariance.)
The value of Channel[0] is displayed all the way to the right in the
'Fit' section..</P>
<p>To
perform a fit, simply slide the 'Fit Order' slider to the desired
order of polynomial you would like to use. Spanc displays the degrees
of freedom in the 'd.o.f.' box, and requires that there be at least
one degree of freedom before it will perform a fit.  When performing
a fit, Spanc first assumes the channels (x-axis) to be exact, and
performs a weighted fit using the &#961;
error bars (y-axis).  This is a standard linear regression with error
bars in the y-axis. It then uses this fit as an approximation to
determine an effective contribution of the channel error bars in the
y-axis (fit slope at channel &#183; channel error bar). This gets added in
quadrature with the given y-error bar to give an effective y-error
bar. A second fit is performed with these effective y-error bars.</P>
<p>'&#967;&#178;/&#957;'
contains the calculated value of the &#967;&#178;
statistic for the fit, divided by degrees of freedom.  The
expectation value for the &#967;&#178; distribution is the number of degrees of freedom.  Therefore,
for good fits, you expect to see a value for '&#967;&#178;/&#957;' near 1. 
The 'p-value' field contains the tail probability of the &#967;&#178;
distribution for this fit.  It is the probability that '&#967;&#178;/&#957;'
would be equal to or greater than the present calculated value if the
fit does, in fact, represent the true calibration curve. Ideally, it
should be greater than 0.90 or 0.95, but anything above 0.5 should be
OK, in my opinion.  The true check of the goodness-of-fit is to take
a look at the residuals, which are listed in the second table in the
'Fit' section. The 'Resid./Sigma' column uses the effective y-error
bars calculated for the fit.  If the fit is good, about 2/3 of the
values in this column should be less than 1.  One wouldn't expect
more than about one in twenty values to be greater than 2.</P>
<p>The
fitted parameters, along with their associated error bars are listed
in the first table in the 'Fit' section.  The error bars are simply
the square of the appropriate diagonal element in the covariance
matrix. The covariance matrix is displayed to the right in the same
table.</P>
