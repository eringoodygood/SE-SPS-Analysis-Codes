<h3>Entering
Calibration Peak Information</H3>
<p>Calibration
peaks in Spanc are specified by a reaction, a projectile excitation
energy, a residual excitation energy, and a centroid channel. To add
a calibration peak, click 'Add Peak' in the 'Calibration Peaks'
section of the main window. This displays an 'Add Calibration Peak'
dialog.</P>
<p>Select
which reaction the peak belongs to using the 'Reaction' slider.  You
<B>must</B> do this at least once, even if it appears that your
desired reaction is already selected.  Enter an excitation energy in
MeV for the projectile.  A default value of 0 is already present. 
Projectile excitation energies are assumed to be exact in Spanc at
the present time.  Enter the residual excitation energy in MeV in the
'Ex Residual [MeV]' field, and the uncertainty in keV in the 'Ex
Residual Unc. [keV]' field.  These units were chosen because they are
the standard units used in the Table of Isotopes. In the next two
fields, enter the centroid channel for your peak, and its
uncertainty.</P>
<p>Clicking
'OK' or 'Apply' creates the peak, and adds it to the 'Calibration
Peaks' table in the main window.  &#961;
is calculated automatically for the peak, along with an uncertainty
based on entered residual excitation energy. If any reaction
participant nuclides have been specified as having mass uncertainty
(see the section on entering reaction information), their mass
uncertainties are also included in &#961;'s
uncertainty. Spanc gets its
nuclear masses from the 2003 atomic mass evaluation
(as provided by the file <code>mass.mas03</code>
available at
<U><A HREF="http://csnwww.in2p3.fr/AMDC/web/amdcw_en.html">http://csnwww.in2p3.fr/AMDC/web/amdcw_en.html</A></U>).</P>
<p>Spanc
assumes that the nuclear interaction point in the target is exactly
halfway through the specified interaction layer.  Beam energy loss is
calculated up to this point (for normal incidence), and used as the
beam energy in the 2-body kinematics calculation.  The projectile has
its energy loss through the remainder of the target.  The projectile
energy loss uses the exit angle out of the target into the
spectrometer.  The final projectile energy after exiting the target
is reflected in the reported &#961;
value. Energy losses are calculated using the formulas given in
Ziegler&#185;.</P>
